Once roaming freely across much of Asia, the Royal Bengal Tiger has seen its numbers dwindle due to poaching, habitat loss, and human-wildlife conflict. Tigers are solitary, territorial animals, requiring large areas to hunt and breed. Today, they are largely confined to protected forest reserves and national parks. Males can grow up to 3.1 meters in length and weigh over 220 kg. They are apex predators and hunt using stealth and strength.

### Role in Ecology
As apex predators, Royal Bengal Tigers play a vital role in regulating prey populations such as deer and wild boar. This top-down control maintains the balance and diversity of the ecosystem. A healthy tiger population is an indicator of a healthy forest, which in turn supports thousands of other species, including humans.

Despite ongoing conservation efforts, their survival is still threatened. Every tiger counts. Watch our short film that carries their message for humanity.

### Importance of Biodiversity
Biodiversity (or Biological Diversity) is a term that describes the variety of living beings on earth, and includes diversity across species, within species, and across ecosystems. It is vital to maintaining the balance of the ecosystem. According to scientific estimates there are 8.7 million species on the planet.a:T12cb,
### The Species
Western Black Rhinoceros (scientific name: *Diceros bicornis longipes*), a subspecies of the Black Rhinoceros family, was formally given a conservation status of **Extinct** in 2011.

Estimates say that there were about a million extant black rhinos in Africa at the beginning of the 20th century, and the number had reduced to the vicinity of a couple of thousand individuals by the beginning of the 21st century. Prolonged years of poaching on a mass scale precipitated this rhino-calypse, along with depleting habitat.
The two‐horned Western Black Rhinos emerged about 7 to 8 million years ago. Once widespread in the savanna of sub‐Saharan Africa, they had very poor eyesight but excellent senses of smell and hearing. Their diet mainly included leafy plants and shoots around their habitat.

### Role in Ecology
Rhinos are considered ‘megaherbivores’ and play an extremely important role in diversifying plant life and creating grazing spots. They are considered an ‘umbrella species’ or a ‘keystone species’ — their survival is closely tied to the survival of other species in their habitat and ecosystem. Rhinos help in maintaining the savanna grassland, a fragile ecosystem that sustains many species. Through their grazing, the rhinos help in increasing biodiversity by allowing other species a better chance of survival. A decline in the population of rhinos starts changing the composition of the grassland, which has a downstream effect on other animals.

### The Species
Wallace’s Golden Birdwing (scientific name: *Ornithoptera croesus*) is named after Alfred Russel Wallace (close collaborator of Charles Darwin), who described the species in 1858. He wrote:
> “The beauty and brilliancy of this insect are indescribable, and none but a naturalist can understand the intense excitement I experienced when I at length captured it. On taking it out of my net and opening the glorious wings, my heart began to beat violently, the blood rushed to my head, and I felt much more like fainting than I have done when in apprehension of immediate death. I had a headache the rest of the day, so great was the excitement produced by what will appear to most people a very inadequate cause.”

It has a conservation status of **Near Threatened**.

The ‘croesus’ in its scientific name, Ornithoptera croesus, comes from King Croesus of Lydia, an iron-age kingdom. This butterfly is normally found in Indonesia. Like other birdwing species, it is sexually dimorphic: the two sexes display physical characteristics that differ beyond the sexual organs. The male butterfly has black forewings with a yellow/orange/golden leading edge, and golden yellow hindwings with black edges. The female butterfly has brown wings with yellow chevron markings.

### Role in Ecology
The presence of butterflies and moths implies a healthy ecosystem and is a good indicator of biodiversity. They’re quite vulnerable to changes in their habitat and massive, humanity-driven changes are pushing them to the brink. Butterflies (along with other insects) play an extremely important role in plant pollination and enable genetic mutations in plant species. They are known to travel long distances, facilitating long-distance pollination. They also act as lower members of the food chain and their diminishing populations have a reductive upstream effect on other members of the food chain. They have been used in many scientific studies to advance our understanding of the insect world.

![Vaquita](/assets/vaquita-001.webp)

Identified only as recently as 1958, this species has been pushed towards extinction due to illegal fishing operations in marine protected areas. It often gets unintentionally caught (bycatch) in fishing gillnets. Now there are reportedly fewer than 30 individuals surviving. Vaquita inhabits shallow lagoons, is between 1.2–1.5m long, and uses bio sonar for communication and navigation.

### Role in Ecology
Porpoises and dolphins are at the higher echelons of the food chain, and contribute towards maintaining the balance of the ecosystem. Their population in the ocean has a downstream effect on the marine ecosystem and is also an indicator of ocean health.

In 2024, just 19 Vaquitas are known to be surviving. They are on their way to extinction. Watch our short film that carries their message for humanity.

It is a large bird with a striking plumage characterised by black-and-white markings, and has a glossy-bluish black head and neck. It thrives in natural wetlands like freshwater marshes, swamps, lakes, floodplains and estuaries. The population of the Black-necked Stork is thinly and widely distributed, making it difficult to assess its conservation status. Environmental degradation is slowly edging out these birds. Recently a Black-necked Stork was found with its beak jammed by a rubber ring, and was rescued by Indian wildlife officials. A pair of Storks can bond and cohabit for several years.

### Role in Ecology
Storks are wading birds that help in facilitating the ecology of fresh water wetlands. They play a critical role in the food chain by consuming smaller species like invertebrates, amphibians and fish, thereby helping to maintain the balance in the populations of these species.

### Importance of Biodiversity
Biodiversity (or Biological Diversity) is a term that describes the variety of living beings on earth, and includes diversity across species, within species, and across ecosystems. It is vital to maintaining the balance of the ecosystem. According to scientific estimates there are 8.7 million species on the planet.e:T108b,
### The Species
Satanic Leaf-tailed Gecko (scientific name: *Uroplatus phantasticus*), a nocturnal reptile endemic to Madagascar, is adept at escaping predators. Belgian-British zoologist George Albert Boulenger first described this species in 1888, giving it the name Uroplatus (Latinized Greek for ‘flat-tail’) phantasticus (Latin for ‘imaginary’).

It has a conservation status of **Least Concern**.

The ‘Satanic’ reference in its common name perhaps comes from its eyes (which can be red) and horn-like features above the eyes. This gecko is tiny: adults can usually range between 3–6 cm in size, are generally brown in color but can also be shades of brown, yellow, orange. To escape predators (snakes, rats, owls and such), it employs various tricks: it can mimic the texture of a dead leaf, shed its leaf-like tail, flatten its body to reduce its shadow, or bare its jaws to scare.

### Role in Ecology
Geckos are generally vital to maintaining fragile ecosystems as they help to contain the population of insects, cockroaches, spiders and worms. Uroplatus phantasticus is not very tolerant to changes in its rainforest habitat, and changes in its immediate environment will affect the ability of this species to survive.

A rare sighting of these turtles was reported from north-east India, and conservation efforts were made to revive them (outcome not clear). Increasingly hostile environmental conditions have taken this species to the brink.

![Black Softshell Turtle](/assets/turtle-001.webp)

### Role in Ecology
Turtles were one of the earliest reptiles on Earth: they co-existed with dinosaurs and survived the meteoric impacts that wiped out the dinosaurs. Their populations are usually higher in tropical and lower temperate regions. They play an important role in the ecology of their habitat by acting as scavengers and helping to maintain aquatic vegetation. Turtles spend a number of years developing a hard shell for survival, and can take long to attain sexual maturity. This trait decreases their survivability in an increasingly hostile natural environment.

The male is white in color and gets whiter as it gets older, while the female is darker or mottled white. Usually found in the northern circumpolar region (Alaska, Canada, Greenland, northern Europe and Asia), this nomadic bird of prey has an average lifespan of 10 years. It has an impressive build, keen eyesight and remarkable hearing. It likes to eat lemmings, and an adult may eat as many as 1600 lemmings a year. It inhabits the open tundra and is a ground-nester, and may migrate depending on the availability of food.
